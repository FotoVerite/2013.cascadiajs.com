## Abstract

Don't like your options for hanging out with local JS folks? Start your own user group.

There are a few tips, tricks, leadership, and orginizational skills that will help you oginize, and particiapte in your local meet (or drink) up. Most importantly as an orginizer you will want make sure to create a consistent, high quality event that folks feel pumped to be a part of. But how do you do that? How do you find a venue, speakers, sponsors? How to you keep recruiters away? How do you let people know about your event?

There are a bunch of variables but they can be easily managed. I'll share how we run the [JS.LA][jsla] group and a few of the things we have learned along the way.

You don't need permision to start a group, you just need to make it happen ;)
